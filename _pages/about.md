I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the Computational Communication Collaboratory at Nanjing University under the supervision of [Cheng-Jun Wang](https://chengjunwang.com/). My research interests lie in the intersection of computational narrative and historical analysis. Specifically, I am engaged in a project that explores the evolution of China's diplomatic landscape from the 1950s to the 1970s, aiming to uncover compelling narratives through data-driven methods.
